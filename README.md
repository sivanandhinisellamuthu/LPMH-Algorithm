# LPMH-Algorithm
Java implementation of the Layered Permutation and Mixing Hash (LPMH) algorithm.
## Overview
**Layered Permutation and Mixing Hash**The Layered Permutation and Mixing Hash (LPMH) algorithm is designed to offer enhanced security and high-speed hashing with increased resistance to collisions, targeting applications in cryptography and data integrity.
 It employs a combination of permutation and mixing techniques across multiple layers to create a robust hash output that is resistant to various forms of attacks, including collision attacks. This algorithm is particularly useful in applications where data integrity and confidentiality are critical.

## Key Features
- **Enhanced Collision Handling**: Minimizes the likelihood of hash collisions, making it more secure for sensitive applications.
- **Speed Optimized for Modern Hardware**:  Compatible with multi-core processing, enabling parallel hashing and GPU compatibility.
- **Parallelizable Design**: Efficient for parallel processing, optimizing performance on modern CPUs and GPUs.
- **High Avalanche Effect**: Small changes in input produce drastically different outputs.

## Why LPMH?
The Layered Permutation and Mixing Hash (LPMH) algorithm is essential for enhancing data integrity, security, and efficiency across various applications. One of its key features is improved collision resistance, significantly reducing the likelihood that different inputs will produce the same hash output, which is crucial for databases and cryptographic applications. LPMH also achieves a more uniform distribution of hash values through its layered permutations, preventing clustering and ensuring optimal performance in data retrieval systems.
